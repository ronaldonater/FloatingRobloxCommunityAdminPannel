# 🛠️ Roblox Community Floating Admin Panel (Tampermonkey Script)

---

This **Tampermonkey userscript** enhances your experience as a Roblox Community **administrator** by adding a sleek, floating **admin panel** directly onto the Roblox Community page you're visiting — *only if you're an admin of that community*.

> ⚠️ You must be an administrator of the community you're viewing for the panel to be active.

## ✨ Features

- 🖱️ **Draggable & Resizable Window**: Organize your workspace exactly how you like it.
- 🧹 **Navbar Cleanup**: Automatically removes unnecessary iframed navigation bars for a cleaner, distraction-free view.
